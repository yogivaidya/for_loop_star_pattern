Python Print Star Pattern Shapes â€“ In this Python Programming tutorial, we will discuss printing different star patterns, shapes, pyramids, triangles, squares etc using nested for loops.

For example, the following Python program will need two nested for loops. The outer for loop is for rows and the inner for loop is for columns or stars.

We use first for loop from 1 to N where N is the number of rows. Similarly, second for loop is used to print stars. We know that there is only one star in first row. There are two stars in line number two and so on. Hence we use second for loop from 1 to i. where i is the row number.
